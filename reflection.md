What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

While doing this assignment I learned more about classes and importing them to different files. I felt that I was able to use a more object-oriented style. I had some difficulty understanding the 'self' parameter and the inventory still needs work. I wanted to be able to do more with the inventory like have it displayed on the terminal.

I would give the advice to ask questions if you're confused about an aspect the assignment and go to office hours or tutoring if you feel you need help.
